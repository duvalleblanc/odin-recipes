This Repo is for the The Odin Project.
This is the first project that involves multiple steps and incorporates skills learned in previous lessons 
put together. 

The learned skills before this project were on the html boilerplate, git, and html elements.

This is the HTML Project for the Foundations Portion of The Odin Project.
The site is utilizing href for images, it has multiple pages to manuever to using href.
The instruction of the project were simply to create the index, 2 recipe pages with instruction on 
how it should look. I really enjoyed the project. I decided to go over and beyond to add some more
flavor and design to the site to make it look more appealing and also for me to have the oppurtunity 
fully see how some of these elements can work together. Since the next section is CSS I left the site 
as the default color and did not incldue anything that I would learn in the next secrtion.
